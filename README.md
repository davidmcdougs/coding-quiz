This assignment was very hard for me.  The html and css came pretty easy.  The javascript was a different story.  I created an html document to mock the example given, with a few changes of my own.  I had thought about putting the highscores and timer in a header, but eventually decided against it mostly because i couldn't get the css to function correctly with it when I had it as a header.  So I created a <div> with its own id to house these elements.  

The most fun in this assignment was in the css.  I really enjoyed playing around with the style and trying to figure out exactly how I wanted it to go.  I created a root css property (after i remembered that was a thing), to house my two main color schemes....not gonna lie, totally forgot about it until I had already copied my primary and secondary colors throughout my entire css....oops...probably the most fun I had was in designing the buttons and having them chenge colors when you hover over them.  

The Javascript was a whole other beast.  Javascript is not something I understand very well so I ended up googling every function and everything i could think of that i needed to make it do and using what I found through my searches.  On top of that many phone calls with friends and a family member who are already developers I was able to sort out my Javascript.
